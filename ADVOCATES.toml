This file lists the Community Advocates for the Chef project.  Community 
Advocates may be assigned for each area where the community convenes online 
(IRC, email list, GitHub, etc.).  Community Advocates are volunteers who have 
the best interests of our community in mind.  They act in good faith to help 
enforce our community guidelines and respond to incidents when they occur.

More information can be found in the [Chef Community Guidelines](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc020-community-guidelines.md).
