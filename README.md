## Usage

Read [RFC000](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md#submitting-an-rfc) for more information on how to submit an RFC and get it reviewed.

## Generating HTML Documentation

To turn the Markdown documents into HTML that can be served from a website on
the gh-pages branch. Git â‰¥ 2.7, Ruby, and the Bundler gem are required.

You'll need to have the gh-pages branch checked out locally:

    git fetch; git checkout -t origin/gh-pages; git checkout master

Run:

    bundle install; bundle exec rake pages:generate

After that there will be a gh-pages subdirectory that has the generated files
and is on the gh-pages branch. These can be committed and pushed to deploy the
website to https://chef.github.io/chef-rfc/.
