# Resource Attribute Improvements

We add a number of enhancements to `attribute`:

- Make nil a valid value (`path nil`)
- Make a nicer type / validation syntax (`property :path, String`)
- Add lazy defaults.
- Add coercion.
- Add `property` (an alias to `attribute`) to `Chef::Resource` to make it available to all users.
- Add `property_is_set?(:property_name)`

## Motivation

    As a Chef user,
    I want to be able to use natural syntax for properties,
    So that I can spend less time writing cookbooks, and make them more readable.

    As a Chef user,
    I want resources to be more readable and ubiquitous,
    So that I can easily tell the interface to things I use.

    As a Chef user,
    I want resource attributes and node attributes to use different words,
    so that they don't lead me to conflate them as concepts.

## Specification

### `property`

`property` will be added to `Chef::Resource` as the primary way to write properties. This is to alleviate confusion around resource and node attributes.

```ruby
class MyResource < Chef::Resource
  property :path, Path, name_attribute: true
  property :content, String
end
```

This calls MyResource.properties[name] = <property type>.

When a property is defined this way:
- `my_resource.<name>` will get the property value.
- `my_resource.<name> = <value>` will set the property value.
- `my_resource.<name> <value>` will set the property value.
- `MyResource.state_attrs` will include the property name.
- `MyResource.properties` will contain the property type.
- The setter and getter manipulate the class variable `@<name>`.

(This is the same as before, except the addition of the `properties` hash.)

### Make nil a valid value

It will now be possible to set a property to `nil` by saying `my_property nil`.  (Currently, this will not change the value of `my_property`.)

In Chef 12, we will keep behavior the same, and *deprecate* the current behavior of silently doing nothing when you set a property to nil.  We will allow properties to explicitly allow `nil`, however, by specifying it explicitly as a valid value: `property :path, [ String, nil ]`.

### Make defaults lazy

`lazy` defaults are automatically run in the context of the *instance*:

```ruby
class MysqlInstall < Chef::Resource
  property :root_path, String, default: '/'
  property :config_path, String, default: lazy { File.join(root_path, 'config') }
end
```

This is a breaking change since `attribute` is the same as `property`, but it is considered a bugfix and not a backcompat feature, so backwards compatibility will not be maintained.

#### `attribute`

`attribute` will remain on LWRPs, and be an alias to `property` with no distinctions.

#### Use `property` instead of `attribute` in documentation

`attribute` will continue to be supported; there are simply too many things in the world to deprecate it. However, any generic documentation that talks about attributes will be renamed to talk about properties. `attribute` itself will still be documented.

We will need to write a comprehensive resource writing guide as well, in order to get it pumped to the top of Google, so that `attribute` comes up less and less often in searches and `property` comes up more and more.

### Property type

Properties with a single type are common enough that we support a "type" for a property, specifiable after its name.

```ruby
class MyResource < Chef::Resource
  property :content, String
end
```

This is actually an alias for `is` (described later here).

#### Reusing types

The type of a property is represented by `Chef::Resource::PropertyType`, and contains accessors for all the properties of a type (`must_be`, `name_attribute`, `kind_of`, etc.).

When you declare `property :name, <type>, <options>`, one of two things happens:

- If the type is a PropertyType instance, it is dup'd and any <option>s are set on the new type.
- If the type is a Class, a new PropertyType instance is created with `kind_of` set to [Class] and any options are set on the new type.
- If type is not passed, a new PropertyType instance is created, and any options are set on the new type.

#### Property Inheritance

Subclasses get properties from their parent.

```ruby
class A < Chef::Resource
  property :a, String
end
class B < Chef::Resource
  property :b, String
end
B.state_attrs -> [ :a, :b ]
```

#### Overriding Properties

When a property is overridden, the override is *complete*: that is, the parent
type is not extended or mixed in any way.

```ruby
class A < Chef::Resource
  property :a, String, default: 'Hello'
end
class B < A
  property :a
end
A.properties[:a].default #=> 'Hello'
B.properties[:a].default #=> nil
```

#### `is`

`is` is a new validation parameter that uses Ruby's match operator `===` (the thing that drives `case` and `when`).

```ruby
# These are equivalent
property :x, [ :a, :b, :c ]
property :x, is: [ :a, :b, :c ]
```

It is worth noting that many existing validations can be expressed directly in terms of `is`:

Old Qualifier          | `is`
-----------------------|---------------
`kind_of: String`      | `is: String`
`equal_to: [ :a, :b ]` | `is: [ :a, :b ]`
`regex: /@chef.io/`    | `is: /@chef.io/`
`respond_to: :merge`   | `is: proc { |v| v.respond_to?(:merge) }`
`cannot_be: :empty`    | `is: proc { |v| !v.empty? }`

As well as some things that were hard to express before:

```ruby
property :path, [ String, :up, :down, nil ]
```

If both `is` and a type are specified, the values in the type are prepended to `is`.

### RSpec matchers

`is` allows for rspec 3 matchers to be passed, and will validate them and print failures.

```ruby
property :path, a_string_starting_with('/')
```

There are no current plans to actually include the matcher syntax in `Resource` by default; users will do this if they want it by doing `include RSpec::Matchers`.

### Coercion

`coerce` is a proc run when the user sets a non-lazy value, or reads a lazy or default value. It allows normalization of input, which makes it simple to create expressive interfaces while preserving a simple programming model that knows what to expect:

```ruby
class File < Chef::Resource
  attribute :mode, coerce: proc { |m| m.is_a?(String) ? m.to_s(8) : m }
end
```

`coerce` procs are run in the context of the instance, so that they have access to other attributes and methods.

### `property_is_set?`

We introduce `property_is_set?(:blah)` to determine whether a given property has been explicitly set on an instance (so you can distinguish between default and non-default values).

```ruby
class X < Chef::Resource
  provides :x
  property :a, default: 1
  property :b, default: 1
end

x 'blah' do
  a 1
  puts a                    #=> 1
  puts property_is_set?(:a) #=> true
  puts b                    #=> 1
  puts property_is_set?(:b) #=> false
end
```

## Backwards Compatibility Summary

Two things will change in Chef 13:

- Lazy defaults: `attribute :x, default: lazy { name }` will run in the context of the instance.
- `nil` is a valid value: `path nil` will set the value of path to nil (or throw a validation error if it is not a valid value).
