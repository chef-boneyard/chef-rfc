# Resource Actions

In this proposal, we allow actions to be specified as recipes, directly in resources.

## Motivation

    As a Chef user,
    I want to be able to write actions in resources,
    so that I don't have to learn and reason about `Provider`s (less friction).

    As a Chef user,
    I want to be able to write actions in resources,
    so that I don't have to switch contexts to understand what resources do.

    As a Chef user,
    I want actions to be specified as recipes by default,
    so that I can use concepts I already know to create good test-and-set resources.

## Specification

To create an action on a resource, users specify `action <action> do ... end`.
The recipe in between the do ... end block will be run when the action is
performed.

```ruby
class MyResource < Chef::Resource::LWRPBase
  attribute :path, name_attribute: true
  attribute :content
  attribute :mode

  action :create do
    ruby_block "Update content of #{path}" do
      only_if { content != IO.read(path) }
      block { IO.write(path, content) }
    end

    execute "Update mode of #{path}" do
      not_if { File.stat(path).mode == mode }
      command "chmod #{mode} #{path}"
    end
  end
end
```

There is no change to providers or the way we run actions.  This is just a way
of defining a provider without having to type or think about the word.  Providers
do not go away, so much as become a secondary concept, a sort of house for the
primary concept of actions.

`action` will work for any resource extending from `Chef::Resource`.

### Action details

#### Action recipe execution

The action recipe works like a Chef run, in that it is an isolated resource
collection and runs actions and notifications the same way as a top level Chef
run.

- The entire action recipe is compiled (just like a normal recipe) before
  converging.
- This compile happens when the action is *run*, not when the parent resource
  is declared.
- Delayed and immediate notifications are local to the action.

This is equivalent to what `use_inline_resources` in an LWRP does, and we will
keep them orthogonal as much as possible.

#### Action composition and inheritance

If the parent class's action is defined using `action`, you may call `super()`
to call the parent class's version of the current action.

```ruby
class MyFile < Chef::Resource::File
  action :create do
    puts "I am a file yo"
    super()
  end
end
```

## Changes to existing things

### Resource

We add the following public API to `Resource`:

- `self.action(action, class: nil, &block)`: creates a handler for the given action

And modify the following:

- `allowed_actions`: defaults to all actions defined by `action`, including any
  actions from superclasses.
- `default_action`: defaults to the first defined `action` in the class or
  superclasses, with the exception of `:nothing`.

Being defined by the `action` keyword, this is backwards compatible: neither of
these definitions change anything about resources that have providers.
