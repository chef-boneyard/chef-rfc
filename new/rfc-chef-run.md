# chef run

The ability to run "one off" recipes to remote machines would be able to empower
a system administrator to leverage Chef and a single Chef recipe to validate a state
of a machine. Having command built into the ChefDK would allow for quick adoption
of Chef's main builtin resources in turn helping with education and the "15 minute"
story of chef.

A good example recipe would be something like `install-and-stop-nginx.rb`:

```ruby
package "nginx" do
  action :install
end

service "nginx" do
  action [ :stop ]
end
```

With this recipe you can ship it off to your clients, see if Chef is installed,
if not, run the `curl -L https://chef.io/chef/install.sh | sudo bash`
then would pragmatically run `chef-client -z install-and-stop-nginx.rb` and have it
us it's idempotent way to verify than nginx is installed but down.

With this tooling the inverse would be possible with something like the following
with a `start-nginx.rb`:

```ruby
service "nginx" do
  action [ :start ]
end
```

With the same workflow, allowing you to bring up your nginx web servers.

## Motivation

    As a system administrator,
    I want to leverage chef resources in a disposable manner,
    so that I can run disposable scripts on remote machines.

## Specification

The general user experience would be the following:

```
$ chef run <ssh|winrm> <hostname> recipe.rb
$ chef run <ssh|winrm> <list-of-hostnames.txt|yml> recipe.rb
```

## Downstream Impact

- There is a `knife` plugin called [knife-solo][solo] that does this type of work
but has not been adopted by the ChefDK.
- There is a `knife` plugin called [knife-zero][zero] that does this type of work
but has not been adopted by the ChefDK either.
