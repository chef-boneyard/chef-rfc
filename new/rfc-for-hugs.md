# Hugging in the Chef Community

In order to bridge the cultural gap between the US and Worldwide community the concept of hugging should be explained.

## Motivation

    As a Chef Community Participant,
    I want to express positive emotion to or for another Chef Community Participant,
    so that we can express our friendship physically.

## Specification

When approaching another Chef Community Member that you wish to engage in a hug. To comply with the already
existing Chef Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct at various community events, you must seek permission from the
other community member by either verbally or physically indicating that you wish to hug them.

An example, but not limited to, of a verbal indication for permission to hug is to ask "Can I give you a hug?" or "Can we hug?"
The other party should then respond with verbal statement; for example "Yes, we can" or "Yes, you may." is a positive reaction, whereas
"No, Thank you." or "No, thanks" are considered negative reactions.

An example, but not limited to, of a physical indication for permission to hug is spread your arms apart from your body. The other
party can indicate permission by repeating the same physical expression to provide consent.

If Community member would like to express a hug, but has a limitation via a sickness or unable to use the typical hug process
they may also express via other means, examples are but not limited to:
- fist bumps
- high fives
- a special 'open to hugs' sticker on a conference badge or nametag
- in the case of an illness
  - [elbow to elbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_bump)
  - backward head nods by moving the chin upwards


A Community member may signal their desire not to participate in the hug. Such signals may include, but are not limited to:
- walking away
- shaking ones head in a sign of "No"
- verbally expressing "No, Thank you."
- crossing your arms over your chest placing your right hand on your left shoulder and left hand on your right shoulder
