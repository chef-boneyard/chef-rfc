# Remove Unused Cookbook Metadata

There are a set of metadata fields that have never been really supported
by Chef, and so we should remove them.

## Motivation

    As a community advocate,
    I want to ensure that cookbook maintainers focus on the things that
    matter,
    so that they can write better cookbooks.

    As a chef developer,
    I like removing code,
    so that there are fewer bugs.

## Specification

Mark as deprecated and subsequently remove the `recommends`, `suggests`,
`conflicts`, `replaces` and `grouping` metadata fields.

## Downstream Impact

Chef Server should be updated to not serve this metadata, docs need to
be updated. Also, generators such as `chef generate`, `berks cookbook`
need to be updated to ensure they do not create metadata files with
those fields.
