# Chef RFC Process and Guidelines

A Chef RFC is a design document describing improvements to Chef. We as a
community use RFCs to document, discuss, and plan improvements to Chef and
other Chef ecosystem tools. You can always find the list of accepted RFCs at
https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc.

## RFC Types

* A **Standards Track** RFC describes a new feature or improvement for Chef or
the Chef ecosystem.
* An **Informational** RFC describes a standard or guideline in the Chef
community. It is not intended to be a binding requirement.
* A **Process** RFC describes a change to development process of Chef or
related projects.

## Roles

* The **Decider** has final say to accept or reject an RFC. The top-level
decider is [Adam Jacob](mailto:adam@getchef.com). The decider can delegate their
authority on a per-subsystem or per-RFC basis.
* The **Editors** manage the Chef RFC repository and assist with the RFC
workflow. They are not responsible for managing the content of RFCs, only
formatting and procedure. To volunteer as an editor please create a pull
request against this document that adds your name to the list. The existing
editors will vote on the request, with the Decider retaining veto power. The
current editors are:
  * Noah Kantrowitz \<noah@coderanger.net\>
  * Jon Cowie \<jcowie@etsy.com\>
  * Bryan McLellan \<btm@loftninjas.org\>
  * Adam Leff \<adam@leff.co\>
* The **Author(s)** submit RFCs and shepherd them through the process with the
assistance of the editors. Unless otherwise specified, the author(s) of an RFC
also implement the feature or process once accepted.

## Submitting an RFC

RFCs are managed in the [chef-rfc GitHub repository](#). When creating a new
RFC, add it to the `new/` folder. A template is provided [below](#). Submit a
pull-request with your new RFC. The Editors will review your submission and when
it is formatted correctly, they will assign it an RFC number which should then
be added to the filename and metadata. [ed: do we just want to use ticket numbers?]

The community will discuss the proposed changes and when the Decider feels
consensus has been reached, they will accept or reject the RFC.

Unless otherwise stated, the RFC author is also volunteering to implement the
feature or process if accepted.

## What belongs in a successful RFC?

Each RFC will generally include the following sections:

1. **Metadata** – Yaml frontmatter including the RFC ID number, author(s),
status, and type.
2. **Description** – A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
being addressed.
3. **Motivation** – The **why** of this change, especially if the change has an
impact on compatibility. The the greatest extent possible, realistic use cases
should be cited. This generally includes an agile user story.
4. **Specification** – The **what** of this change. The technical specification
should describe the new feature or enhancement being proposed. This includes any
DSL or server API changes.
5. **Rationale** – The **how** of this change. The rationale fleshes out the
specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design
decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered
and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other tools. The
rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss
important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
6. **Copyright** – All RFCs must be placed in the public domain.

This is neither an exhaustive list nor a set of requirements, but it is a good
place to start.

## RFC Review and Workflow

All new RFCs start off as drafts. At any point the author(s) can withdraw the
RFC if they feel it doesn't merit further discussion. Once consensus is reached,
the Decider for the RFC will accept or reject the RFC. For Standards Track RFCs,
once the feature is implemented in a released version of the relevant software
the RFC is marked as Final, indicating discussion of further changes to the
feature should take place in a new RFC. If an RFC is superseded by a later RFC,
the original one should be marked as Replaced.
