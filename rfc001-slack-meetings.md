# How

## Roles

Each meeting must have the following roles assigned:

1. Moderator: this person decides who has the floor, and is in charge of moving the agenda along.
2. Secretary: this person is responsible for condensing the content of the meeting into meeting notes, and sharing them with the chef-dev list within 24 hours of the meetings conclusion.
2. Speakers: the agenda may have multiple speakers assigned to a topic.

If the standing Moderator or Secretary is unavailable to attend, they will delegate their role to another
community member.

## Agendas

### Standing Agenda

Each meeting should have a standing agenda, which the meeting will default to
unless otherwise stated in advance.

### Timing

Meetings should be run to a schedule. Agendas should have draft time slots,
and the boundaries should be held.

### Agendas are shared prior to the meeting

Agendas will be sent out 24 hours prior to the meeting, via email to the chef-dev
mailing list. If no agenda is sent out in advance, the standing agenda is the
meetings agenda.

## Running a meeting

### Start

1. The meeting begins by the moderator declaring the meeting open.
2. The moderator will link to this RFC for new-comers to review what it means to be in a meeting.
3. The moderator will review the agenda, and give the floor to the first speaker.

### Timing

As an agenda item nears its time limit, the moderator will give a 2 minute warning, then close the
topic.

### Questions and answers

It is up to the moderator and speakers to manage the back-and-forth flow of questions and answers,
depending on the nature of the topic on the agenda, and the comfort of the speaker. If the speaker
requests participants hold questions to the end, please be respectful.

## Meeting Conduct

Please be aware of the [Community Guidelines](https://docs.chef.io/community_guidelines.html).

We will follow the same [code of conduct as ChefConf and the Community summit](https://www.chef.io/blog/chefconfcodeofconduct/#long_code_of_conduct).

## Moderator can de-voice or ban

The moderator has the right to de-voice, or in extreme circumstances ban completely, participants
who either fail to conduct themselves appropriately, or are detrimental to the meeting.

The moderator will give one warning in advance of taking action.
