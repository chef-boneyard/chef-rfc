<h1>Chef Platform Policy</h1>

<p>The purpose of this RFC is to clarify which platforms the Chef community chooses to work on, and how those platforms are maintained.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.chef.io/">chef docs site</a> has <a href="https://docs.chef.io/platforms.html">details of the platforms Chef Software, Inc validates for release</a>.</p>

<h1>Adding a new platform</h1>

<p>Community maintenance of a platform requires that core chef resources,
including <code>package</code>, <code>file</code>, and <code>service</code>, MUST have working providers
for the platform. For example, on Debian the package provider supports both
<code>dpkg</code> and <code>apt</code>. Ohai SHOULD also be able to gather relevant
information on the platform.</p>

<p>In addition to support in code, there SHOULD be a Lieutenant for the
platform, per RFC 30. There MAY also be one or more Maintainers for the
platform. The Lieutenant and any Maintainers are responsible for
reviewing RFCs and code that affects the platform, and SHOULD be
responsible for ensuring that new versions of the platform are
supported.</p>

<h1>Currently supported platforms</h1>

<p>If not specified, chef works with all versions of a given
platform that the manufacturer supports.</p>
