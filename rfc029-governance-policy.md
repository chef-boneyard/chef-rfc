# Chef Board of Governance

Chef was designed from the outset to have a very open structure, including open design, open contribution, and consistent use of tools across the project. Given the large numbers of contributors, users, and companies with a stake in the future of the project, Chef leadership is looking to establish an advisory board, as part of its long term commitment to open governance.


The Chef Board of Governance (CBGB) was officially closed on Septemeber 7, 2018 because the original concerns of the CBGB have been mostly addressed.
