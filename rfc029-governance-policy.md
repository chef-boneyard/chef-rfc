# Chef Board of Governance

Chef was designed from the outset to have a very open structure, including open design, open contribution, and consistent use of tools across the project. Given the large numbers of contributors, users, and companies with a stake in the future of the project, Chef leadership is looking to establish an advisory board, as part of its long term commitment to open governance.

The purpose of this RFC is to create that governance board and define how it will work.

## Purpose

## What’s Included

The following main areas are included in this proposal:

## Operation

The CBGB is authorized to seek advice and counsel from other interested parties and invited experts as appropriate

Any outside party wishing to bring an issue before the CBGB may do so by emailing the CBGB mailing list, [cbgb@chef.io](mailto:cbgb@chef.io).

The CBGB shall provide transparent and timely reporting (through any mechanism it deems appropriate) to the Community at large on all of its activities, subject to the right of any individual to designate their comments and the ensuing discussion as "in confidence," in which case the public report shall contain only a note of the request and an agreed summary (if any) of the substance.

The CBGB is being formed at the discretion of the Company Leadership. The Company Leadership alone may decide to terminate the CBGB in its sole discretion; provided however, that the Company Leadership shall first consult the CBGB Chair.

The CBGB and its members shall abide by appropriate antitrust guidelines.

### Open Governance Principles

The CBGB will formulate recommendations in conjunction with the following, open governance principles:

#### Open participation

Throughout the project:  anyone should be able to participate and contribute. All bugs and tasks will be tracked in a public tracker and all of the source code and all of the tools needed to build it will be available under an open license permitting unrestricted use

Open technical value: technical value over pride of authorship. Code is contributed for the express purpose of advancing technologies relevant to the project, effectively separating technology advancement from individual or commercial intent.

Open design: Roadmaps are discussed in the open, and design receives input from all contributors and maintainers

Influence through contribution: organizations and individuals gain influence over the project through contribution.

IP Cleanliness: Steps are taken to ensure that all incoming code is legally contributed (CLAs, terms-of-use, etc.), that use of approved third party libraries does not create incompatible dependencies

Open Licensing: code should be licensed using approved, standard, open-source licenses. (Chef is currently licensed under Apache 2.0).

## Grievance Handling

When a member has a concern about the Chef Project, the member may raise that concern with the CBGB.  If the member is not satisfied with the result, the member can raise the concern directly with the Project Lead.   All appeals and discussions will be open, transparent and public.
