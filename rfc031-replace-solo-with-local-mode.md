# Replace chef-solo with chef-client local mode

Replace chef-solo's core with chef-client "local-mode," to run chef without an external Chef Server

## Motivation

    As a Chef user,
    I want to run and use Chef without a server,
    so that I am using the same API and core features,
    and so that I can use any published cookbooks.

Case in point, the `chef-solo-search` cookbook exists to provide search-like functionality so that users of `chef-solo` can use public cookbooks unmodified.

The `knife-solo` RubyGem exists to make it easier to distribute the parts of a "chef repository" to target nodes. However, it has a completely different workflow than what users who have a Chef Server use, leading to confusion and differences in help systems such as IRC and the mailing list.

Amazon Web Services "OpsWorks" uses `chef-solo` as its implementation, which leads to issues with workflow and support similar to `knife-solo`.

There doesn't exist a clear and easy way for `chef-solo` users to migrate to a `chef-client`/Chef Server implementation and vice versa, due to the lack of "server" features.

## Specification

This RFC proposes to replace `chef-solo` with `chef-client --local-mode`. The`chef-solo` command will continue to exist, and to the extent possible, work with existing solo-specific workflows without modification.

This means that `chef-solo` using "local mode" **must** be 100% backwards-compatible with existing `chef-solo` usage.

The local mode feature of `chef-client` uses `chef-zero`, an in-memory API-complete implementation of the Chef Server. This would give "solo" users the capability of performing searches, "saving" node objects, and easily saving and retrieving data bags. The `chef-zero` server can persist data to disk, allowing that to be distributed to other nodes as necessary.

The application implementation of `chef-solo` would be changed to invoke `chef-client` with `Chef::Config[:local_mode]` set to `true` by default in the application class.

## Rationale

Chef has always had `chef-solo`, a standalone recipe execution engine that can run recipes on nodes. However, as new `chef-client`/Chef Server features are added, they slowly trickle down to `chef-solo`, if they even get implemented at all. This makes `solo` users unable to have complete consistency when consuming cookbooks from the community.

This will also simplify the codebase, as there is a great deal of duplication between `Chef::Application::Solo` and `Chef::Application::Client`. This would create a single place to go for the application config - the `Chef::Application::Client` class.
