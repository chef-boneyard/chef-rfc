# Chef code should have a consistent style

There is a high cognitive load involved in switching between projects
that have different or inconsistent code styles that impacts developer
productivity and happiness. Chef should produce a consistent code style
for its open source ruby code and apply it.

## Motivation

    As a developer,
    I want to be productive quickly in all Chef's projects,
    so that I can concentrate on writing code.

## Specification

https://github.com/chef/chefstyle provides a rubocop configuration that
is intended to be applied to chef/chef and related projects, such as
chef/ohai, and chef/mixlib-\*. The community should arrive, via
pull requests to `chefstyle`, at a set of style checks that can be
enforced (via travis, etc) on chef community maintained ruby projects.

Chefstyle, by default, disables all rubocop cops, providing a clean
sheet for us to build upon. PRs to enable rules should be accompanied
with a PR to chef/chef demonstrating the feasibility of enabling the
rule and to allow discussion of actual changes.

This style checker is not intended for use with cookbooks, which have
different requirements.
