# Chef Release Cadence

Chef follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for releases. Major
versions (eg. 11.x -> 12.x) will include backwards-incompatible changes, minor
versions (eg 12.1 -> 12.2) will include new features and bug fixes but will be
backwards-compatible to the best of our ability. Patch versions are governed
by [RFC 47](rfc047-release-process.md).

Chef feature releases are promoted to the stable channel once per month. It is
expected that this occur during the second week of the month unless
circumstances intervene. Additional patch releases for a given feature release
may be promoted if critical issues are found.

ChefDK is released once per month. It is expected that this occur during the
fourth week of the month unless circumstances intervene.

Both Chef and ChefDK will prepare a release candidate before the target release
date, usually in the week before but at least three business days before release.

The Chef release in April of each year is a major version release, which will
contain backwards-incompatible changes. A reminder notice will be sent via
Discourse and Slack in March that will summarize the changes slated for the release.

## Rationale

Monthly releases help ensure we get new features and minor bug fixes out to Chef
users in a timely fashion while not overloading the maintainer teams.
Similarly, offsetting the Chef and ChefDK releases allows the full attention of
the Chef development team on each of those releases and leaves time for any
potential hot fixes or follow-up.

Major releases in April avoids releasing during winter holidays, summer
vacations, ChefConf and Chef Summits.

## Cookbook and Ecosystem Tooling Support

The latest version of Chef-managed community cookbooks should support at least the latest 6
months of Chef Client versions.  After 6 months, Chef-managed community cookbooks may
elect to drop support for older Chef Client versions.  This window does not reset on
a major version release so that the prior major version track is supported for a 6 month
window.  Non-Chef-managed community cookbooks are encouraged to follow this policy.

As an example, in May we will typically release 14.1.0 and both 14.0 and 14.1 will be
supported.  The version of 13 release 6 months prior should be 13.8 and will still
be supported so that 6 versions will be considered current (13.8 through 13.11 plus
14.0 and 14.1).  At that point community cookbooks may choose to start using 13.8
features and drop support for versions prior to 13.7

Tooling external to cookbooks (cookstyle, chefspec, stove, foodcritic, halite,
poise-hoist, etc) is similarly encouraged to follow this policy.

## Rationale

This allows cookbook authors to drop support for old cookbook versions and use new
features in new client versions.  It gets us out of the situation where cookbooks still
need to support 28-month old versions of Chef Client versions and can't use any features
added in the past 28-months of software development.

## Ruby Cadence

Since the Ruby language itself releases new minor versions over the Christmas holidays,
the April major release of Chef Client should include the minor revision of Ruby which
landed the prior Christmas.  Combined with the 6 month sliding window for cookbook
support that also implies that when the prior major release of the client falls off
of community cookbook support that the prior minor release of Ruby will also fall
off of community cookbook support (including the cookstyle gem and related tooling).

The release of the new major version may be delayed if there are show stopping bugs
in the released version of Ruby (we assume that 4 months will be enough time for
major regressions in the core language to be addressed, but that is an external
dependency).

If the Ruby language version released over Christmas has a show-stopper bug then the
next major Chef Client version may be released without it.  It can then be included
in a subsequent minor version bump.  This RFC deliberately uses 'should' instead of
'must', and [RFC-034](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/b7bd9c53bf96235f9334e65bb5848f7843c81fed/rfc034-ruby-193-eol.md#specification)
allows for a minor version bump of Ruby with a minor version
bump of Chef Client.  Show stoppers in Ruby itself will not hold up major releases
of Chef Client, and missing the major release window will not hold up bumping the
Ruby version.

## Rationale

This also allows cookbook authors and the ecosystem to drop support for old versions of
the Ruby language, which itself only has a useful support window of about 24-months.  When
we had to support 28-months old Chef Client versions that themselves were shipping 12-24
month old Ruby platforms that meant that cookbooks and tooling had to support some 40-52
month old Ruby versions -- long after the Ruby community had stopped support.  The combined
sliding windows here means that the support windows for Chef and Ruby will be more
synchronized.

The combined sliding window of Chef Client support of Ruby and cookbook and ecosystem
support of Chef Client needs to better match the Ruby language support window.  As
external gem authors tend to drop support of Ruby versions that fall into security-only
releases, we also plan on dropping support of Ruby versions once they fall into
security-only releases.  For example, in Q1 of 2016 ruby-2.3.0 had been released,
ruby 2.2.x was still being maintained and ruby-2.1.x fell into security-only releases,
which caused many rubygems -- most notably rack-2.0 and activesupport-5.0 to later
drop support for ruby-2.1.x.  This caused issues everywhere in the Chef ecosystem
as Chef Client had stayed on ruby-2.1 until it became a crisis, and we were forced
to work around supporting ruby versions that the rubygems community had dropped
support for.  The Ruby, Cookbook and Ecosystem support cadence is design specifically
to avoid this situation.
