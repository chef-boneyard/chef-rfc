# Audit Segment

Support audit and compliance checks in a technology agnostic way.

## Motivation

    As a cookbook author,
    I want to ship custom controls,
    so that I can ensure my nodes are compliant.

    As a cookbook author,
    I want to use the most suitable compliance library,
    so that I can write controls effectively.

    As an operator,
    I want to ensure that my converge happens separately from my audit,
    so that I have full control over my runs.


## Specification

As per RFC-35, audits will be run in the `audit` phase, which occurs
after the `converge` phase completes.

An audit handler will be introduced to allow cookbooks to register for
the audit phase.

The current, Serverspec based audit mode will be migrated to a cookbook
and removed from the chef-client.

A cookbook may depend on other gems in the usual manner to provide
functionality to audit tests.

Tools will be updated to upload the `tests` directory to both
supermarket and chef server. Audits can then be used both at development
time with test kitchen and similar tools, and with audit mode.
