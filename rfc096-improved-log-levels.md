# Improved Log Levels

Presently, the only way to debug a failing chef run is to enable debug
logging, which is intended more for the maintainers of Chef than for a
systems engineer. We would like to move to a structured metadata model
that allows us to slice and dice log messages.

## Motivation

    As a Chef maintainer,
    I want to know exactly what chef is doing,
    so that I can maintain and develop chef.

    As a cookbook author,
    I want to ensure that my cookbook is interacting with the system as
    I expect,
    so that I can write cookbooks efficiently.

    As a systems engineer,
    I want to see the output of running commands,
    so that I can debug chef failures.

## Specification

We propose to move the chef client, and related libraries, to a
structured logging format. This would allow us to tag individual log
messages with extended metadata, such as the resource/subsystem, the
cookbook we're running in, the log level and so on.

We would then update the logging commands to allow the user to specify a
set of tags that they're interested in, allowing a user to only get log
output from the resources associated with a single cookbook.

## Downstream Impact

Any libraries that Chef includes (such as Ohai, mixlib-authentication
and so on) would need to be updated to use structured logging.
